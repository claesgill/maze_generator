# Maze Generator Visulization  
This is a maze generator visulization that run in the browser. It uses the [Recursive backtracker method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm) to create a maze of size *n*. A live version of this is found at my [website](http://www.claesgill.com/mazegenerator).

You can play around whit the variables in the `setupCanvas()`-function:  
* `cols` the number of columns
* `rows` the number of rows
* `cellSize` the size of one cell
